# Data Structures

The repository is a collection of own implementations of some popular data structures in C++. 

| Name          | Note                                                                                          | Source | Unit Tests |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|
| Dynamic Array |  Random-access sequence container (array) <br> that can automatically handle its size when needed. |[dynamic_array.hpp] | [dyn_arr_tests.cpp] |
| Stack         |  Linear data structure which follows the LIFO principle.                                      |     [stack_linked.hpp]  | [stack_tests.cpp]    |
| Doubly linked list         |  The doubly linked list is a variation of a linked list (linear data structure) in which each node, apart from storing its data, has two links for the previous and the next node (bidirectional).     |     [list.hpp]  | [list_tests.cpp]    |
